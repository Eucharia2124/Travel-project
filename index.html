                <h2>Why Lisbon</h2>
                <h3>Lisbon, the city of light of seven hills</h3>
                <p>
                    The legend had it that Lisbon was named Olissipo by the Romans, for its resemblance to the Roman capital. Just like Rome, Lisbon began its life as a humble setttlement nestled among seven hills. However it wasn't until the 17th century, in the writting of Frey  Nicolao d'Oliveira, that Lisbon came to be called 'a cidade das sete colinas' - the city of seven hills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can still see traces pf ancient Lison today. Beyond the array of shops with international brands, peaceful streetside cafes selling the iconic pastel de nata, and world class restauarants with a varity of global cuisine, you can still wonder the seven hills and see the city from above, taking in the rolling terracotta rooftops the whitewashed walls an on the horizon, the sofe blue sea.
